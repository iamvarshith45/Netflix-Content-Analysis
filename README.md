# Netflix-Content-Analysis
Developed and implemented a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning pipeline to extract actionable insights from a Netflix content dataset. 
Cleaned and preprocessed raw data, including date feature engineering ('added year', 'added month') and imputing missing values using advanced techniques like Iterative Imputer for improved data quality. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) utilizing diverse data visualization techniques (bar charts, histograms) to identify trends in content distribution across countries, release years, target age groups, and genres. Leveraged K-Means Clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction to segment Netflix content into distinct groups based on characteristics such as type, country, rating, and prevalent genres. Employed Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis for optimal cluster determination. Utilized Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Scikit-learn to drive data-driven decision-making and uncover patterns in content strategy.
